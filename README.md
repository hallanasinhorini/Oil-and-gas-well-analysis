# Oil and Gas Well Data Analysis - Data Generator and Analysis

 This project aims to provide a foundation for analyzing synthetic oil and gas well data, performing basic statistical analysis using NumPy, and visualizing the data using Matplotlib. It serves as a starting point for more comprehensive reservoir characterization and analysis.

- Generating synthetic well data for depth, porosity, and permeability.
- Calculating basic statistics using NumPy functions.
- Visualizing data with Matplotlib.

You can build upon this foundation to create more advanced reservoir analysis tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
